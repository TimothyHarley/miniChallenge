            <p>This is me.  My name is Tim, and that handsome dog behind me is Logan.  As you can probably see from my shirt, I like StarWars.  My favorite icecream is cookie dough.  I also like beer, the x-men, and videogames.  Those aren't all of my interests, but I'll stop there.</p>

            <p>This is my favorite dinosaur.  It's called Deinonichus.  It's name is greek for 'terrible claw'.  This dinosaur is famous for it's depiction in both the novel and the movie Jurrasic Park.  Both Michael Crichton and Steven Spielburg changed it's name to Velociraptor because it sounded more menacing, even though real velociraptors were much smaller and not incredibly threatening.  It was recently discovered that Deinonychus was covered in feathers and had a much more bird-like appearance than previeously thought.  This picture by artist Emily Willouby is one of the most up-to-date illustrations in terms of scientific accuracy.</p>
